ERM FINANCIAL TOOL v1.01 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Be sure to install to the 'D' drive - installing to the 'C' drive will not work on most WHO computers as we do not have admin rights by default

2. After installation, run the programme either by double-clicking the desktop shortcut (if one was created), or by going Start > All Programs > ERM Financial Tool > ERM Financial Tool

3. You will be asked to locate the data file - this window will open in K:\clData\ERM_Financial_Tool\ by default, but you can navigate to another location (N.B this will not work if the drive where the data file is located is protected)

4. When the report has been produced, you will be asked where you would like to save the file. The default location is K:\clData\ERM_Financial_Tool, but you can navigate to another directory if yiou prefer. The report and it's containing folder will both open upon selection.
